Base language taken from [pyforth]([GitHub - joelpeckham/pyforth: OPL Final Project](https://github.com/joelpeckham/pyforth)) with some added features like `."`, computation timeout, and floating point arithmetic that are probably implemented wrong

## Main feature: runs as a Discord bot!!!

set the `TOKEN` environment variable in a .env and run `python bot.py`
